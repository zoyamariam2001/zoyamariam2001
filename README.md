### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Zoya Patel from India. Apart from being a computer engineering student, I'm a creative writer, too.

- ðŸ”¨ Iâ€™m currently working on building a demo website for a bakery.
- ðŸ“– Iâ€™m currently learning data structures, Bootstrap, jQuery, SQL, PHP, C++.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, HTML, CSS.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to contact me on: zoyamariam7@gmail.com

- ðŸ˜Š Random facts about me: loves reading, obsesses over fictional characters, watches superhero movies passionately, can code for hours back to back or can't code for hours at all- there's no in-between, enjoys star-gazing, into music, fooooodddd.


Have a nice day!
